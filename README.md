## C# X-Tensions API

#### Description  
Starting with X-Ways Forensics v16.4 (released in early 2012), investigators have been able to automate and extend the functionality of X-Ways Forensics with X-Tensions. 

Since X-Tensions can be written in any programming language, the possibilities are endless.

#### Helper Methods and Wrappers
In order to speed up development of new X-Tensions, we created some helper methods for commonly used operations.  

XWFGetVolumeName
XWFGetReportTableAssocs
XWFGetSectorContents
XWFGetItemType
XWFGetVolumeInformation
XWFSearchWithoutCodePages
ReadItem(IntPtr hItem)  
GetFullPath(Int32 itemId)
CreateFileFromExternalFile
CreateSearchInfo


####  Features 
- This is a full feature compliant port of the C++ demo located here  
- All exported functions are present  


#### ChangeLog  

Updated to support 16.9 X-Ways
